<h1 id="xia-api">XIA API</h1><p>It from <strong>Programmer&apos;s Manual Digital Gamma Finder (DGF) PIXIE-16</strong> <em>Version 1.40, October 2009</em></p><hr><pre><code class="lang-cpp">// Configure modules for communication in PXI chassis
// Use this function to configure the Pixie-16 modules in the PXI chassis.
// NumModules is the total number of Pixie-16 modules installed in the system. PXISlotMap is the pointer to an array that must have at least as many entries as there are Pixie-16 modules in the chassis.
// PXISlotMap serves as a simple mapping of the logical module number and the physical slot number that the modules reside in. The logical module number runs from 0. For instance, in a system with 5 Pixie-16 modules, these 5 modules may occupy slots 3 through 7. The user must fill PXISlotMap as follows: PXISlotMap = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...} since module number 0 resides in slot number 3, etc. To find out in which slot a module is located, any piece of subsequent code can use the expression PXISlotMap[ModNum], where ModNum is the logic module number.
// OfflineMode is used to indicate to the API whether the system is running in OFFLINE mode (1) or ONLINE mode (0). OFFLINE mode is useful for situations where no Pixie-16 modules are present but users can still test their calls to the API functions in their application software.
// This function must be called as the first step in the boot process. It makes the modules known to the system and &#x201C;opens&#x201D; each module for communication.
// The function relies on an initialization file (pxisys.ini) that contains information about the Host PC&#x2019;s PCI buses, including the slot enumeration scheme. XIA&#x2019;s software distribution normally puts this file under the same folder as Pixie-16 software installation folder. However, the user has the flexibility of putting it in other folders by simply changing the definition of the string PCISysIniFile_Windows or PCISysIniFile_Linux in the header part of the file pixie16sys.c, depending on which operating system is being used.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16InitSystem (
    unsigned short NumModules,    // total number of Pixie16 modules in the system
    unsigned short *PXISlotMap,   // an array containing the PXI slot number for each pixie16 module
    unsigned short OfflineMode ); // specify if the system is in offline mode

// Release user virtual addressees assigned to modules
// Use this function to release the user virtual addressees that are assigned to Pixie-16 modules when these modules are initialized by function Pixie16InitSystem. This function should be called before a user&#x2019;s application exits.
// If ModNum is set to less than the total number of modules in the system, only the module specified by ModNum will be closed. But if ModNum is equal to the total number of modules in the system, e.g. there are 5 modules in the chassis and ModNum = 5, then all modules in the system will be closed altogether. Note that the modules are counted starting at 0.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16ExitSystem (
    unsigned short ModNum );      // module number

    unsigned int   *ModSerNum,    // returned module serial number
    unsigned short *ModADCBits,   // returned module ADC bits
    unsigned short *ModADCMSPS ); // returned module ADC sampling rate

// Boot modules so that they can be set up for data taking
// Use this function to boot Pixie-16 modules so that they can be set up for data taking. The function downloads to the Pixie-16 modules the communication FPGA configurations, signal processing FPGA configurations, trigger FPGA configurations (Revision A modules only),
executable code for the digital signal processor (DSP), and DSP parameters.
// The FPGA configurations consist of a fixed number of words depending on the hardware mounted on the modules; the DSP codes have a length which depends on the actual compiled code; and the set of DSP parameters always consists of 1280 32-bit words for each module. The host software has to make the names of those boot data files on the hard disk available to the boot function.
// If ModNum is set to be less than the total number of modules in the system, only the module specified by ModNum will be booted. But if ModNum is equal to the total number of modules in the system, e.g. there are 5 modules in the chassis and ModNum = 5, then all modules in the system will be booted.
// The boot pattern is a bit mask (shown below) indicating which on-board chip will be booted. Under normal circumstances, all on-board chips should be booted, i.e. the boot pattern would be 0x7F. For Rev-B, C, D modules, bit 1, i.e., &#x201C;Boot trigger FPGA&#x201D;, will be ignored even if that bit is set to 1.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16BootModule (
    char *ComFPGAConfigFile,      // name of communications FPGA configuration file
    char *SPFPGAConfigFile,       // name of signal processing FPGA configuration file
    char *TrigFPGAConfigFile,     // name of trigger FPGA configuration file
    char *DSPCodeFile,            // name of executable code file for digital signal processor (DSP)

// Acquire ADC traces in single or multiple modules
// Use this function to acquire ADC traces from Pixie-16 modules. Specify the module using ModNum. If ModNum is set to be less than the total number of modules in the system, only the module specified by ModNum will have its ADC traces acquired. But if ModNum is equal to the total number of modules in the system, then all modules in the system will have their ADC traces acquired.
// After the successful return of this function, the DSP&apos;s internal memory will be filled with ADC trace data. A user&apos;s application software should then call another function Pixie16ReadSglChanADCTrace to read the ADC trace data out to the host computer, channel by channel.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16AcquireADCTrace (
    unsigned short ModNum );      // module number

// Read ADC trace data from a channel in a module
// Use this function to read ADC trace data from a Pixie-16 module. Before calling this function, another function Pixie16AcquireADCTrace should be called to fill the DSP internal memory first. Also, the host code should allocate appropriate amount of memory to store the trace data. The ADC trace data length for each channel is 8192. Since the trace data are 16-bit unsigned integers (actually only the lower 14-bit contains real data due to the on-board 14-bit ADC), two consecutive 16-bit words are packed into one 32-bit word in the DSP internal memory. So for each channel, 4096 32-bit words are read out first from the DSP, and then each 32-bit word is unpacked to form two 16-bit words.
// Specify the module using ModNum and the channel on the module using ChanNum. Note that both the modules and channels are counted starting at 0.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16ReadSglChanADCTrace (

    unsigned short ModNum,        // module number
    unsigned short ChanNum );     // channel number

// Transfer data between host and DSP internal memory
// Use this function to directly transfer data between the host and the DSP internal memory of a Pixie-16 module. The DSP internal memory is split into two blocks with address range 0x40000 to 0x4FFFF for the first block and address range 0x50000 to 0x5FFFF for the second block. Within the first block, address range 0x40000 to 0x49FFF is reserved for program memory and shouldn&#x2019;t be accessed directly by the host. Address range 0x4A000 to 0x4A4FF is used by the DSP I/O parameters which are stored in the configuration files (.set files) in the host. Within this range, 0x4A000 to 0x4A33F can be both read and written, but 0x4A340 to 0x4A4FF can only be read but not written. The remaining address range (0x4A500 to 4FFFF) in the first block and the entire second block (0x50000 to 0x5FFFF) should only be read but not written by the host. Use Direction = 1 for read and Direction = 0 for write.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16IMbufferIO (
    unsigned int *Buffer,         // buffer data
    unsigned int NumWords,        // number of buffer words to read or write

// Transfer data between host and DSP external memory
// Use this function to directly read data from or write data to the on-board external memory of a Pixie-16 module. The valid memory address is from 0x0 to 0x7FFFF (32-bit wide). Use Direction = 1 for read and Direction = 0 for write.
// The external memory is used to store the histogram data accumulated for each of the 16 channels of a Pixie-16 module. Each channel has a fixed histogram length of 32768 words(32-bit wide), and the placement of the histogram data in the memory is in the same order of the channel number, i.e. channel 0 occupies memory address 0x0 to 0x7FFF, channel 1 occupies 0x8000 to 0xFFFF, and so on.
// NOTE: another function Pixie16ReadHistogramFromModule can also be used to read out the histograms except that it needs to be called channel by channel.
// In Rev-A modules, part of the external memory is also used to store the list mode data in ping-pong buffering mode. This function can be used to read list mode data from the buffers.
PIXIE16APP_EXPORT int PIXIE16APP_API Pixie16EMbufferIO (

    unsigned short ModNum );      // module number

// Start a list mode data acquisition run
// Use this function to start a list mode data acquisition run in Pixie-16 modules. List mode run is used to collect data on an event-by-event basis, gathering energies, timestamps, pulse shape analysis values, and waveforms, for each event. Runs will continue until a preset number of events are reached or the user terminates the run by calling function Pixie16EndRun. Once the run is progress, if the run is set to terminate after a given number of events have been accumulated, another function, Pixie16CheckRunStatus, should be called to check if the run has finished. To start the data acquisition this function has to be called for every Pixie-16 module in the system. If all modules are to run synchronously, The last module addressed will release all others and the acquisition starts then. The first module to end the run will immediately stop the run in all other modules.
// Use mode=NEW_RUN (=1) to erase histograms and statistics information before launching the new run. Note that this will cause a start up delay of up to 1 millisecond. Use mode=RESUME_RUN (=0) to resume an earlier run. This mode has a start up delay of only
a few microseconds.
// For Rev-A modules, currently there are 4 list mode run types supported. They are 0x100 (general purpose run), 0x101 (without waveforms), 0x102 (without auxiliary data) and 0x103 (energy and timestamp only).
// For Rev-B, C, D modules, there are only one list mode run type supported, that is, 0x100. However, different output data options can be chosen by enabling or disabling different CHANCSRA bits.
// Histograms and statistics data are updated incrementally from run to run provided RESUME_RUN mode is used.
// ModNum is the module number which starts counting at 0. If ModNum is set to be less than the total number of modules in the system, only the module specified by ModNum will have its list mode run started. But if ModNum is set to equal to the total number of modules in the system, then all modules in the system will have their runs started together.

// Start a MCA histogram mode data acquisition run
// Use this function to begin a data acquisition run that accumulates energy histograms, one for each channel. It launches a data acquisition run in which only energy information is preserved and histogrammed locally to each channel.
// Call this function for each Pixie-16 module in the system. The last module addressed will allow the actual data acquisition to begin. Histogram run can be self-terminating when the elapsed run time exceeds the preset run time, or the user can prematurely terminate the run by calling Pixie16EndRun. On completion, final histogram and statistics data will be available.
// Use mode=NEW_RUN (=1) to erase histograms and statistics information before launching the new run. Use mode=RESUME_RUN (=0) to resume an earlier run.
// ModNum is the module number which starts counting at 0. If ModNum is set to be less than the total number of modules in the system, only the module specified by ModNum will have its histogram run started.

// Use this function to check the run status of a Pixie-16 module while a list mode data acquisition run is in progress. If the run is still in progress continue polling.
// If the return code of this function indicates the run has finished, there might still be some data in the external memory (Rev-A modules) or external FIFO (Rev-B, C, D modules) that need to be read out to the host. In addition, final run statistics and histogram data are available for reading out too.
// In MCA histogram run mode, this function can also be called to check if the run is still in progress even though it is normally self-terminating.
